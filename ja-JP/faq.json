    "answer1": "ICO is an acronym for Initial Coin Offering. ICOs are an excellent tool for innovative and potential projects to be able to raise funds for execution through the launch of a new cryptocurrency. Generally, projects that use Blockchain technology launch a digital currency with its own characteristics and offer them for sale. The purpose of the project is to engage a whole community of first-time users that believe in the project's disruptive potential.",
    "answer2": "Swapy Token (ERC20) is a cryptocurrency launched for the Swapy.Network project, which aims to provide Universal Access to Credit. Swapy Token allows you to build a financial ecosystem around the services offered, ensuring access to the network by the owners of the tokens. All the services offered by Swapy.Network use Swapy Token as an official currency to access these services.",
    "answer3": "Swapy Network is a collaborative network where financial institutions and individuals can interact directly in order to have services such as credit, investments, insurance or even making their own data available in exchange for Swapy tokens. Through our Swapy Network, you will have access to Swapy Exchange, Swapy Financial ID and Swapy DataMarket, as well as other services that can be added to the network in the future.",
    "answer4": "The demand for Swapy Tokens may influence on its price variation, which may be positive or negative. With the success of our network it is expected that Swapy token increases its market value. This is an interesting advantage for early adopters of the platform. However, Swapy Token should not be bought with the right expectation or promise of profit, since it is not characterized as an investment similar to shares, debentures, fixed income securities or derivatives. The Token does not follow a targeted benchmarking, that is, it does not pursue official rates or performance of financial market indices. In this way, it does not represent company shares, it will not distribute profits or dividends. The purpose of the token is to be a common medium of exchange by facilitating payment for the services of individuals or organizations that interact on the Swapy Network platform.",
    "answer5": "Currently, large and companies open capital, that is, IPO (Initial Public Offering) of their shares. They publicly offer, through Stock Exchanges, part of their actions to other persons or institutions that are not the original partners / founders. In IPOs, the business in question is already validated and commercially established, requiring only more capital to expand at the desired speed.",
    "answer5a": "On the other hand, ICOs work in reverse. Generally, blockchain projects in the initial stages, but with great technological, social and transforming potential, offer part of their crypto-coins to finance their execution. Therefore, the ICO should not be seen as investment nor be associated with the IPO.",
    "answer6": "There are two main phases, the presale that starts on September 15 and the crowdsale that starts on October 24. In both steps, interested individuals or entities should exchange the corresponding amount of Ether (ETH) for the desired amount of Swapy Tokens. In the presale will be accepted offers with a minimum amount of 33 Ethers, whereas in the crowdsale will be accepted any valid amount.",
    "answer6a": "Instructions will be posted through our Newsletter, Channel on Slack and website, simultaneously. Make sure that all these channels are aligned with the same information before making your transfer. If you have any questions, please contact us directly. The method indicated to store your Ethers before making the exchange by Swapy Tokens is MYETHERWALLET.COM. For security, type letter by letter in your browser. We do not send links through our media to proceed with the purchase of tokens.",
    "answer7": "Yes. We offer pre-sale discounts as follows:",
    "answer7a": "50% discount until we raise an amount of 5000 Ethers.",
    "answer7b": "25% discount until we raise an amount of 30000 Ethers.",
    "answer7c": "10% discount until we raise an amount of 90000 Ethers.",
    "answer7d": "5% discount until we raise an amount of 180000 Ethers.",
    "answer7e": "Are you Interested? Subscribe to our newsletter for updates.",
    "answer8": "Swapy Tokens can only be sold at the end of the crowdsale phase. From there, tokens can be sold when the buyer wishes, as long as there is demand for the currency. The sale may be made at exchanges of crypto-coins indicated by the Swapy Network team. For this, it will be necessary to register in one of the exchanges indicated to make the exchange. Each exchange has a specific rate for this type of service.",
    "answer9": "No. Tokens are not shares. In this way, who buys a token can use it in the Swapy Network, resell or store the crypto coins. Swapy Token owners have no participatory rights in the company, only token usage rights.",
    "answer10": "All services offered on the Swapy Network will be accessible exclusively through Swapy Tokens, each with its specific value. By switching directly with us (Ether by Swapy Token), during the presale and crowdsale phases, you will have access to the predetermined launch price. After the crowdsale ends, the token value is subject to variations according to supply and demand."
